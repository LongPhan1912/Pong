# Pong

Welcome to Pong!
Built via Python's pygame module.

Inspired by GeeksforGeeks' tutorial: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-pong-game-in-python-pygame/, I added some UI customizations of my own and modified the codebase with additional helper functions to enhance code readability and modularization.
